## Datasets
We started out with 4 Datasets from Vanguard:
- df_final_demo.txt
- df_final_experiment_clients.txt
- df_final_web_date_pt_1.txt
- df_final_webdata_pt_2.txt

The most important columns for our project:
From df_final_demo.txt
- client_id
- logon_6_mnth
- clnt_tenure_yr
  
From df_final_experiment_clients
- client_id
- Variation (whether the clients were in the test or the control group)

From df_final_web_data_pt_1.txt & df_final_webdata_pt_2.txt
- client_id
- process_step
  
## About Vanguard
Vanguard is one of the world's largest investment management companies, founded in 1975 and serving over 50 million clients worldwide. As part of their ongoing commitment to improving the client experience, Vanguard conducted an A/B test to evaluate whether a new user interface design leads to higher process completion rates among their clients. 

The client bases primary consist of established, midle to older aged clients

## Business question
Does the new Vanguard UI design drive higher process completion rates, and if so, does the improvement justify the investment?

## Hypotheses 
**1: Completion Rate**
**H₀:** The new design does not increase the completion rate compared to the old design. 
The completion rate in the Test group is less than or equal to the completion rate in 
the Control group.

**H₁:** The new design increases the completion rate compared to the old design. 
The completion rate in the Test group is higher than the completion rate in the Control group. 

**2: Completion Rate with a Cost-Effectiveness Threshold**
**H₀:** The new process design does not achieve the minimum required increase in completion rate. The difference in completion rate between the test group and the control group is less than 5%, meaning the new design is not cost-effective

**H₁:** The new process design achieves or exceeds the minimum required increase in completion rate. The difference in completion rate between the test group and the control group is 5% or more, meaning the new design is cost-effective and its benefits outweigh the associated costs of design, development, testing, staff training and potential user disruptions.

**3: Completion Rate according to tenure years**
**H₀:** The completion rate of the new process does not differ significantly from the old process across tenure groups

**H₁:** The completion rate of the new process differs significantly from the old process across at least one tenure group

## Data Cleaning & Obstacles

The dataset was relatively clean and therefore did not present any significant obstacles. We removed rows that contained only null values, with the exception of the client_id, and merged the datasets df_final_web_data_pt_1 and df_final_web_data_pt_2.

The primary challenges we encountered were related to alignment, communication, and mutual understanding within the team. Although communication was ongoing, some misunderstandings arose, and different approaches were taken to address errors encountered during the process. While this was not a major issue, it was ultimately insightful to observe that the overall error rate was relatively low. However, it did require us to realign at a later stage of the project.

## Methodology

To compare completion rates between the test and control groups, a Chi-square test was used as completion is a categorical variable (completed/not completed). To verify that the groups were balanced in terms of client tenure, an independent samples T-test was applied, preceded by Levene's test for equality of variances and a normality check. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used throughout the analysis.

## Results

**The results show:**

The duration of the experiment lasted long enough to get a proper overview about the results but: The experiment groups are partially imbalanced, particularly in user behavior, which may bias the results.
 
- We have to **reject** the first H₀: Completion Rate.
H₀: The new design does not increase the completion rate compared to the old design. 
The completion rate in the Test group is less than or equal to the completion rate in 
the Control group.
    The new design does increase the completion rate:

    | | Completion Rate |
    |---|---|
    | Control (Old UI) | 65.59% |
    | Test (New UI) | 69.29% |
    | Difference | +3.7% |
    

- The second H₀: Completion Rate with a Cost-Effectiveness Threshold we **reject**.
H₀: The new process design does not achieve the minimum required increase in completion rate. The difference in completion rate between the test group and the control group is less than 5%, meaning the new design is not cost-effective.
The new UI performs better with a relative lift of **5.65%**


- The last H₀: Completion Rate according to tenure years we have to **reject**.
H₀: The completion rate of the new process does not differ significantly from the old process across tenure groups
Especially under the newer clients the new UI does better with up to 3.9% better in the tenure group 6-10 years. 


## Additional insights
 
- Missing start events are minimal and similarly distributed across the test (0.05%) and control (0.08%) groups. This indicates a minor technical tracking issue that is not related to the UI design and does not impact the validity of the analysis.
- A subset of clients returns to previous steps before proceeding again, indicating some level of navigation backtracking within the process.
- Some clients skip intermediate steps entirely. Specifically, 228 clients in the test group and 349 clients in the control group completed the process without going through all steps.
- Step repetition is relatively high in both groups, with 51.46% in the control group and 55.11% in the test group. This may warrant further investigation, particularly given the higher repetition rate observed in the new UI.
- Drop off rates per step: 
    - **Biggest win for new UI:** After Start: 14% vs 9.1% — the new UI is much better at keeping clients engaged initially! 
    - **Problem area** → After Step 1: the new UI loses slightly more clients here — something about Step 1 needs improvement! 
    - **Step 3** is the biggest drop-off for BOTH groups → this step needs attention regardless of which UI is used!
 

## Business Recommendations

The new UI shows promise and already meets the 5% cost-effectiveness threshold (observed improvement: 5.65% relative lift). We recommend full implementation at this stage.

Key actions to improve the new UI:
• Investigate and reduce process drop-offs
• Resolve process integrity errors (clients confirming without completing all steps)
• Develop a tailored approach for long-tenure clients (31+ years) who perform better under the old process

We are confident that addressing these issues will push completion rates even more.
